            Exchange physical gold to crypto XAU and vice-versa in an OTC transaction.
            In anticipation of Texas' return to acceptance of Gold and other precious metals as legal tender and the creation of Commodity Banks in Texas, this app demonstrates the ability to reversibly convert physical gold to a digital proxy.  Additionally, we will demonstrate using the XAU as a fund source to complete a BTC-priced purchase.
